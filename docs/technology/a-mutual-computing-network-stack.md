# A Mutual Computing Network Stack

Current cloud services can be costly, with questionable security. We present the design and implementation of a Mutual Computing Network Stack (MCNS) where users do not need to trust remote data centers. We remove any trust points from the middle of the network and leverage blockchains to secure critical service bindings. MCNS implements services for identity, discovery, and storage and can survive failures of distributed computing nodes. MCNS gives comparable performance to traditional cloud services and enables a much-needed security and reliability upgrade to the traditional cloud.
